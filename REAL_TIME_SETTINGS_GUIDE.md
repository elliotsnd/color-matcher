üöÄ Quick Start
I'll analyze the web interface to identify all the adjustable settings and provide you with the complete list of API endpoints that allow real-time control from the command line. Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's the complete list of API endpoints for real-time command line control of all adjustable settings:

üéØ Complete ESP32 Color Matcher API Endpoints
To achieve the most accurate color readings from your sensor, it's crucial to adjust its settings in a specific and logical order. The process moves from foundational hardware settings to more nuanced software corrections. Following this sequence ensures that each adjustment builds upon a stable and optimized base.
Here is the recommended order for adjusting your color sensor's settings using the provided API endpoints:

Foundational Setup: Illumination and Basic Sensitivity The first and most critical step is to establish a consistent lighting environment and configure the sensor's basic sensitivity. The goal is to get a strong, stable signal without overwhelming the sensor (saturation). For this, you will primarily use a neutral white or light gray reference object. Set LED Brightness: Begin by setting the illumination. The brightness should be sufficient to clearly light the object you intend to measure but not so bright that it causes reflections or saturation. API Endpoint: GET /api/set-led-brightness?value={0-255} Example: curl "http://192.168.0.152/api/set-led-brightness?value=100" Adjust Integration Time and Gain: These two settings work together to control the sensor's sensitivity to light. Integration Time: This is akin to a camera's shutter speed. A longer time allows more light to be gathered, which is ideal for darker objects. Start with a mid-range value. API Endpoint: GET /api/set-integration-time?value={0-255} Example: curl "http://192.168.0.152/api/set-integration-time?value=55" ALS Gain & High Gain: This amplifies the signal from the light sensor. Higher gain is beneficial for low-light conditions or when trying to distinguish between very similar colors. API Endpoint: GET /api/set-advanced-sensor?alsGain={0-3}&highGain={true/false} Example: curl "http://192.168.0.152/api/set-advanced-sensor?alsGain=2" Pro-Tip: A good method for this step is to place a white reference object in front of the sensor. Adjust the integration time and gain until the raw r, g, and b values from the /api/color endpoint are as high as possible without reaching the maximum value (which would indicate saturation). This maximizes the dynamic range of the sensor.[1]
Signal Stabilization: Averaging Samples Once you have a good, strong signal, you can improve the stability and repeatability of the readings by taking multiple samples and averaging them. This will help to reduce noise from the sensor and the environment. Set Color Samples: Determine the number of readings you want to average for each color measurement. More samples will yield a more stable result but will take longer. API Endpoint: GET /api/set-color-samples?value={1-10} Example: curl "http://192.168.0.152/api/set-color-samples?value=5" Set Sample Delay: Define the brief pause between each sample. A small delay can sometimes improve accuracy. API Endpoint: GET /api/set-sample-delay?value={1-50ms} Example: curl "http://192.168.0.152/api/set-sample-delay?value=2"
Refining Accuracy: IR Compensation Many light sources, including ambient light, can contain an infrared (IR) component that can interfere with the accuracy of color readings.[2] The TCS3430 sensor has features to help mitigate this. Set IR Compensation Factors: These factors are used to subtract the influence of infrared light from your color readings. Determining the optimal values may require some experimentation. One approach is to measure a material that is known to reflect IR light and adjust the factors to minimize its impact on the color measurement. API Endpoint: GET /api/set-ir-factors?ir1={0.0-2.0}&ir2={0.0-2.0} Example: curl "http://192.168.0.152/api/set-ir-factors?ir1=0.35&ir2=0.34"
Advanced Correction: Quadratic Calibration This is the final and most advanced step for achieving the highest color accuracy. Quadratic calibration applies a mathematical correction to the raw RGB values, compensating for any non-linear responses in the sensor.[3][4] This step is crucial when you need to match colors to a specific standard, like the CIE 1931 color space.[5][6] Set Quadratic Calibration Coefficients: To use this feature effectively, you would typically measure a set of standardized color references (like a color calibration chart). You would then use a separate program to calculate the ideal quadratic coefficients that map the sensor's readings to the known values of your color standards. These calculated coefficients are then sent to the device. API Endpoint: GET /api/set-quadratic-calibration?r_a=...&r_b=...&r_c=...&g_a=...&g_b=...&g_c=...&b_a=...&b_b=...&b_c=... Example: curl "http://192.168.0.152/api/set-quadratic-calibration?r_a=5.756615e-06&r_b=-0.108&r_c=663.2&..." After completing this process, remember to save your optimized settings to the device's persistent storage so they are not lost on restart. Save Settings: GET /api/save-settings
